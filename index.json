[{"content":"As members of the Students\u0026rsquo; Federation of India (SFI), we are proud to represent one of the largest and most active student organizations in India. Founded in 1936, SFI has a long history of struggle for students\u0026rsquo; rights and social justice within India.\nOur organization inherits the legacy of anti-imperialism and patriotism from the Indian independence movement. Throughout its existence, SFI has stood at the forefront of fighting for students\u0026rsquo; academic demands and participating in protests on important social and political issues impacting India. Some of our key contributions include organizing students to participate in the Quit India movement in 1942 and opposing the recent UGC draft proposal for the Four Year Undergraduate Programme due to concerns it is disconnected from ground realities of the Indian higher education system.\nAs an organization politically aligned with left-wing ideologies, SFI strives to uphold secular and democratic values on college campuses. We work to promote social equality and oppose any form of discrimination based on caste, religion, gender or other identities. Over the decades, SFI has also played an important role in the rise of progressive student politics in India and mobilizing youth to support national independence as well as workers\u0026rsquo; rights.\nToday, with over 5.9 million members across India, SFI continues its mission of advocating for students and bringing more voices into the movement for social and educational justice. As long-standing members of this prestigious organization, we are proud of its legacy and look forward to continuing the struggle in the spirit of our forebears. SFI will keep fighting to make higher education accessible to all Indians and empower the next generation of socially conscious leaders.\n","date":"16 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"SFI-EFLU","summary":"As members of the Students\u0026rsquo; Federation of India (SFI), we are proud to represent one of the largest and most active student organizations in India.","title":"About Us"},{"content":"","date":"16 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/anniversary/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Anniversary"},{"content":"SFI EFLU organized a protest gathering against the BJP government’s unconstitutional implementation of CAA.

A true revolutionary, whose life constantly reminds us that not only should we advocate for a social order in which everyone lives with equality and contentment, but also to join the revolutionary struggle for it. Marx was not an economist or a political thinker alone. He set out a revolutionary philosophy, a philosophy, the scope of which covers not only politics but the whole of human history, economics, society and nature. But that philosophy which is a combination of the dialectical method with materialism created a powerful combination of theory and practice which can bring about revolutionary transformation.\nAs Marx himself said “The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it”.\n","date":"16 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/6/","section":"SFI-EFLU","summary":"Today marks the 141st death anniversary of Karl Marx.","title":"Karl Marx's Death Anniversary"},{"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, officia excepteur ex fugiat reprehenderit enim labore culpa sint ad nisi Lorem pariatur mollit ex esse exercitation amet.
